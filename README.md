This cookicutter is inspired by [Levit's Django CookieCutter template for DRF apps](https://bitbucket.org/levit_scs/cc_project_app_drf) 
and the project app achitecture. You can watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajEDo1semzs) to get an idea of what
the project app is.

You can use this cookiecutter to bootstrap your django & graphql powered projects. It comes with the default django User model exposed
as a graphql api. You can use it to learn creating graphql apis to be consumed by your dyanamic  javascript clients like Angular, Emberjs e.t.c.

Also included is support for Bootstrap 4 and django-rest-framework.

In order to be able to use it you need to have [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) installed.

When the project generation is complete please open your browser and head over to (localhost:8000/api/v1) and begin playing aroound
with your graphql api in the browser. After that you can create users in the admin and begin to query your database via the graphql end point.
